        <h1>Christmas Day</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December
            25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A liturgical feast
            central to Christianity, Christmas preparation begins on the First Sunday of Advent and it is followed by
            Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas
            Day is a public holiday in many countries, is observed religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as
            celebrated culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the annual holiday season.

            The customs associated with Christmas in various countries have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and
            secular themes and origins. Popular holiday traditions include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or
            Advent wreath; Christmas music and caroling; watching Christmas movies; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange
            of Christmas cards; attending church services; a special meal; and displaying various Christmas decorations,
            including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, poinsettias, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and
            holly.

            Additionally, several related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas,
            Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season
            and have their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas
            festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales
            period for retailers and businesses. Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing
            economic effect in many regions of the world.
