        <h3><i>My Intrests</i></h3>
        <p>
            I'm interested in anything that has to do with <strong>science or medicine</strong>. I'm planning to take
            multiple science classes here at the high school including Advanced and AP Chemistry, AP Physics 1 & 2, as
            well as Advanced and AP Biology. Because of this, I really try to keep my grades up and work hard to be the
            best student I can. I'd really like to go to a good college, get my B.S. in Biochemistry, get to Medical
            School, graduate and become licences as a Doctor of Medicine or a Doctor of Ostheopathic Medicine, and
            become an Anesthesiologist. I believe medicine and science are crucial to society as they drive innovation
            and can help people live better, more fufilling lives.

        <h4><i>My Hobbies</i></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Cinema:</strong> I really enjoy movies and T.V. shows as I believe they can be a stress reliever
                and can be a bonding experience. My family loves to hang out and watch gameshows together. Some of my
                favorite movies include Barbie, Mamma Mia, and Carry On. Some of my favorite T.V. shows include
                Jeopardy, Gray's Anatomy, and Fuller House.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Music:</strong> I also enjoy music. It offers companionship and expression, as well as it makes
                me feel good as I vary my music depending on my mood. Some of my favorite music artists are Taylor
                Swift, Ed Sheeran, Chappel Roan, and Lizzo.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Traveling and Exploring:</strong> I love to travel and explore new places as it bring a
                different prespective and I love trying new things. Some of my favorite places I've been to are Florida,
                Alaska, and Colorado. I'm quite excited for spring break as we are going on a trip to London! This will
                be my first time out of the country and I cannot wait for the adventure.

        <h5><i>Future Plans and Goals</i></h5>
        <p>
            I've got a lot of plans for my future as I'm really excited to become my own person and the person I aspire
            to be. As I previously stated, I am quite academically driven to get good grades. I want to go to a good
            and/or prestigous college, major in and get my B.S. or M.S. in Biochemistry or something similar, go to
            Medical School and graduate as a licensed Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Ostheopathic Medicine, and then
            specialize in Anesthesiology and become an Anesthesiologist. I would like to live somewhere urban and rent
            an apartement, possibly in New York City. I also love to travel so I've compiled a list of 100 places to
            visit before I die. Some notable places include the Golden Triangle of India, Japan, as well as many places
            and countries in Europe. I'd also like to rescue a cat or a dog and give it a good home.
