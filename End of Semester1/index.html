            <h2>All About Crisp and Crumble</h2>
            <p>
                Crisp and Crumble started in a tiny kitchen with a stand mixer named Beatrix and a fridge held together
                by frosting. What began as a side hustle for feeding friends and bribing coworkers quickly spiraled into
                full-blown dessert obsession. With a mission to make treats that taste like childhood but feel like a
                celebration, we opened our first bakery armed with cookie dough, optimism, and exactly zero idea how to
                use a cash register. Spoiler: we figured it out (eventually). Now, our treats are enjoyed by sweet
                seekers near and far — no special occasion required. We have bakery located just outside from Kensington
                Gardens in London, but anyone can enjoy our sweets from our website, with free shipping to the US and
                Europe!
