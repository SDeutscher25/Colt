            <p>
                Come join the paws-itively purr-fect celebration as our beloved feline friend Horus marks his 2nd
                birthday! It’s been two wonderful years of whiskers, cuddles, and playful mischief. Expect plenty of
                treats, toys, and kitty fun as we toast to Horus’s health, happiness, and many more adventures ahead.
                Don’t miss out on this tail-wagging good time—because every cat deserves a birthday bash!
