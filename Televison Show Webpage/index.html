				<h3>Who is Meredith Grey?</h3>
				<p>
					Meredith Grey M.D., F.A.C.S., (born 1977 or 1978) is a fictional and titular character from the
					medical drama television series Grey's Anatomy, which airs on the American Broadcasting Company
					(ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes and is
					portrayed by actress Ellen Pompeo. Meredith made her first appearance in the pilot episode, "A Hard
					Day's Night", broadcast on March 27, 2005. She also appears in the spin-off series Station 19 as a
					recurring character.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meredith is the series' protagonist and was introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle
					Grace Hospital (later Seattle Grace-Mercy West Hospital, and afterward Grey+Sloan Memorial). She
					eventually obtains the position of a surgical resident, and later, the position of an attending
					surgeon. In 2016, she attains the Chief of General Surgery position. As the daughter of
					world-renowned surgeon Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), Meredith struggles with balancing the challenges of
					being in a competitive profession, maintaining her relationship with her one-night stand and
					eventual husband, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), her role as a mother, and her friendships with
					her colleagues. Her relationships with colleagues Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens
					(Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) form a central
					part of the show's early dynamics.
				</p>

					Meredith serves as the narrator of the show and is the focal point of most episodes, though other
					characters' perspectives are also explored. Pompeo's on-screen chemistry with Dempsey has been
					celebrated as a high point of the series. Rhimes has described Meredith as someone who doesn't
					believe in absolute good or bad, but rather does what she feels is right. Meredith Grey has been
					positively received by critics, with Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times calling her "the
					heroine of Grey's Anatomy."
				</p>
				<p>
					Ellen Pompeo appeared in approximately 407 episodes of Grey's Anatomy as Meredith Grey, spanning
					seasons 1-19. While she is no longer a series regular, she continues to voiceover at the beginning
					and end of each episode. She also directed two episodes of Grey's Anatomy. In addition to her work
					on Grey's Anatomy, she also appeared in three episodes of Station 19. She stepped back in 2022 in
					order to prioritze her family and other projects, yet still appears on the show periodically.

				<h3>Christina Yang</h3>
				<img src="yang.png" alt="Christina Yang" height="309px" width="250px"/>
				<h3>Who is Christina Yang?</h3>
				<p>
					Cristina Yang, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.S. is a fictional character from the medical drama television
					series Grey's Anatomy, which has aired for 20 seasons on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in
					the United States. The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes and is portrayed by
					actress Sandra Oh. Cristina was introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace
					Hospital, and over the course of the series, she rose to become a cardiothoracic surgical fellow.
					Her relationships with fellow doctors Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl),
					Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) were central to the show's early
					seasons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cristina became engaged to Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), a cardiothoracic surgeon, but the
					relationship ended on the day of their wedding. Cristina also had a past romantic relationship with
					renowned surgeon and mentor Colin Marlowe (Roger Rees), and later married but eventually divorced
					trauma surgeon Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd).
				</p>
				<p>
					Oh originally auditioned for the role of Miranda Bailey, but the part ultimately went to Chandra
					Wilson. Oh's portrayal of Cristina Yang earned her widespread critical acclaim, with Mark Perigard
					of the Boston Herald highlighting Cristina's friendship with Meredith as "the secret-core of Grey's
					Anatomy". Oh's performance garnered her numerous awards, including a Golden Globe and a Screen
					Actors Guild Award in 2006. She also received five consecutive nominations for the Primetime Emmy
					Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series from 2005 to 2009. Yang has been seen as
					a landmark for Asian representation in Hollywood due to the character breaking away from the usual
					Asian stereotypes and offering a more complex and nuanced portrayal.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cristina was characterized by ABC as competitive, ambitious, and highly intelligent, with her main
					flaw being her aggressive and tactless attitude. In May 2012, E! Online reported that Oh had signed
					on for two more years, alongside her fellow cast members. However, she ultimately left the show
					after Season 10, with her character being written out of the main storyline. Cristina's departure
					marked a significant moment in Grey's Anatomy, as she had been one of the central characters from
					the inception of the series. Her exit, though bittersweet, was written in a way that honored her
					character's ambition and professional dedication, leaving her to continue her career in Zurich,
					Switzerland as the head of a prestigious cardiothoracic department.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cristina Yang appeared in 221 episodes of Grey's Anatomy. Even after leaving following Season 10,
					she was referenced multiple times and appeared to be doing well.
